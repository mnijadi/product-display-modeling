# Statistical Learning Project (In Progress)

## Description

In this project, we will walk through a dataset, analyze it, discover its statistical properties, discover different preprocessing techniques, and finally, build a model to predict the target variable.

## Setup

Create a Pytohn virtual environment:

```{bash}
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install requirements.txt
```
